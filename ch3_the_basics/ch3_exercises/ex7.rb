# My solution:
# The error message tells us that Ruby expected '}', but instead there is
# an unexpected ')'.

# ------------------------------------

# LS solution:
# There is a closing `)` somewhere in the program without a corresponding
# opening `(`. There's also an opening `{` without a corresponding
# closing `}`.
